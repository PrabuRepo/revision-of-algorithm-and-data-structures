-- Pattern of the SQL is as follows
-- SELECT column_one, column_two, column_three FROM table_one
-- JOIN (common_id, count_of_apartment_for_each_tenant) as table_two ON table_one.common_id = table_two.common_id WHERE counter > 1

SELECT
  Tenants.tenantid    ID,
  Tenants.TenantName  NAME,
  count_table.counter APARTMENTS_OWNED
FROM (SELECT
        tenantid,
        COUNT(aptid) counter
      from AptTenants
      GROUP by AptTenants.TenantID) count_table
  JOIN Tenants ON count_table.tenantid = Tenants.tenantid
WHERE count_table.counter > 1;
