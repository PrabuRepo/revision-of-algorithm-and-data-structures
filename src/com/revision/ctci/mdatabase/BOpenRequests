-- Pattern of the SQL is as follows
-- SELECT building_id, building_name, COUNT(requests)
-- FROM buildings LEFT OUTER JOIN buildings_with_open_requests
-- GROUP BY buildings.building_id

SELECT
  Buildings.buildingid   ID,
  Buildings.BuildingName BUILDING_NAME,
  COUNT(sub.a_id)        OPEN_REQUESTS
from Buildings
  LEFT OUTER JOIN
  (SELECT
     Apartments.BuildingID b_id,
     Apartments.aptid      a_id
   from Requests
     join Apartments on Requests.aptid = Apartments.AptID
   WHERE Requests.Status = 'Open') sub
    ON Buildings.BuildingID = sub.b_id
GROUP BY Buildings.BuildingID;
